# Custom Twitch API Command Handlers so that chat can time themselves out

- should be able to listen to chat events (bits/channel points/cheers)
- different chat events allow for different moderator commands to be run (mainly timeout)

# Todo:
- set up sandbox env for twitch
- do more research into twitch oauth/token validation
